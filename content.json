I am curently a PhD candidate from the Envrionmental Research Institute at Shandong University. My research supervisors are Academician Wenxing Wang and Prof. Likun Xue. I have visited in the Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences (CIRES) at University of Colorado Boulder, collaboration with Prof. Joost de Gouw. I am passionate about contributing to a further understanding of the chemical transformation of VOCs/nitrogen oxide in polluted air and numerical simulations of the production of ozone. My current research topic is quantifying the contribution from Volatile Chemical Product (VCP) emissions to ozone formation in Los Angeles. I am a fan of open source and serve as developer of FOQAT.","link":"/index.html"},{"title":"cv","text":"","link":"/cv/index.html"}]}

I have been a postdoctoral fellow working with Professor Tao Wang at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University since December 2022. I graduated from Shandong University in September 2022 and was a member of the Team for Research in Atmospheric Chemistry and Environment (TRACE) (M.S. & Ph.D. advisor: Likun Xue & co-advisor: Professor Joost de Gouw). I visited the Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences (CIRES) at the University of Colorado Boulder for a collaboration with Professor Joost de Gouw from September 2019 to September 2020. I am passionate about contributing to a further understanding of the chemical transformation of VOCs/nitrogen oxide in polluted air and numerical simulations of the production of ozone. My current research topic is quantifying the contribution from Volatile Chemical Product (VCP) emissions to ozone formation in Los Angeles. I am a fan of open source and serve as developer of FOQAT.","link":"/index.html"},{"title":"cv","text":"","link":"/cv/index.html"}]}

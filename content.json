I have been a postdoctoral fellow working with Professor Tao Wang at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University since December 2022. I graduated from Shandong University in September 2022 and was a member of the Team for Research in Atmospheric Chemistry and Environment (TRACE) (M.S. & Ph.D. advisor: Likun Xue & co-advisor: Professor Joost de Gouw). I visited the Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences (CIRES) at the University of Colorado Boulder for a collaboration with Professor Joost de Gouw from September 2019 to September 2020. As an atmospheric researcher, I have always been intrigued by the interactions among the energy system, the natural environment, and human society, and how these will shape the future toward clean air and carbon neutrality. The overarching goal of my research is to investigate the human impact on air quality from an energy perspective, using atmospheric observations as key constraints. I enjoy developing atmospheric chemical models and machine-learning models to help interpret the varied atmospheric compositions from remotely sensed and in-situ observations.","link":"/index.html"},{"title":"cv","text":"","link":"/cv/index.html"}]}

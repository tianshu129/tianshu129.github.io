My research focuses on investigating the human impact on air quality and climate change through the lens of atmospheric chemistry, with particular attention to energy-related species. I combine various methods to explore changing atmospheric compositions, such as spatiotemporal trends in concentrations, using atmospheric observations as key constraints. News July 2025: Tianshu joined the College of Ocean and Atmospheric Sciences at Ocean University of China as an Associate Professor. ðŸŽ‰","link":"/index.html"},{"title":"CV","text":"","link":"/cv/index.html"},{"title":"Publications","text":"","link":"/publications/index.html"},{"title":"Research","text":"","link":"/research/index.html"}]}

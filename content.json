I have been a postdoctoral fellow working with Professor Tao Wang at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University since December 2022. I graduated from Shandong University in September 2022 and was a member of the Team for Research in Atmospheric Chemistry and Environment (TRACE) (M.S. & Ph.D. advisor: Likun Xue & co-advisor: Professor Joost de Gouw). I visited the Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences (CIRES) at the University of Colorado Boulder for a collaboration with Professor Joost de Gouw from September 2019 to September 2020. I have always been captivated by the complex interplay between energy systems, the environment, and human society, and how these interactions will shape the future of clean air and carbon neutrality. My research focuses on investigating the human impact on air quality and climate change through the lens of atmospheric chemistry, with particular attention to energy-related species. I combine various methods to explore changing atmospheric compositions, such as spatiotemporal trends in concentrations, using atmospheric observations as key constraints.","link":"/index.html"},{"title":"cv","text":"","link":"/cv/index.html"}]}
